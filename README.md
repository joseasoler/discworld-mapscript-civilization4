# Discworld: MapScript for Civilization IV
Discworld is a MapScript based on the Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett. It will generate a flat world shaped like a disc, with warm regions near the border and cold regions in the center.

The regions of the resulting map are similar to those of the Discworld, but they are so changed that it will not be easy to guess your position in it from the beginning. Their shapes and relative angles and positions to one another are randomized, and the entire disc is rotated with regard to its center in a random angle. Civilizations can only start in the main regions of the Discworld, ensuring that there is plenty of space available to explore and expand.

Discworld is compatible with Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, and nearly all mods, except Final Frontier and other similar mods.
